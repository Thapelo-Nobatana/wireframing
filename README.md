## Key Elements of a Wireframe

Wireframes focus on functionality, structure, and layout rather than visual style. Here are the key elements typically found in a wireframe:

### 1. Layout Structure

The layout defines the basic arrangement of the page or screen. It ensures that information is presented logically and supports usability.

**Example:**
A homepage might be divided into a header (with logo and navigation), a main content area (with featured items), and a footer (with contact info and links).

**Contribution to Design:**
Provides a visual hierarchy and consistency across different screens or pages.

### 2. Navigation

Navigation components help users move through the application or website. This includes menus, sidebars, tabs, or breadcrumbs.

**Example:**
A top navigation bar with links to "Home," "About Us," "Bookings," and "Contact" allows users to quickly access main sections.

**Contribution to Design:**
Improves usability by ensuring users can find what they need without confusion.

### 3. Content Placement

Content placement involves deciding where to place key information, text, images, and calls to action (CTAs).

**Example:**
Placing a “Book Now” button prominently near the top of the screen increases user engagement.

**Contribution to Design:**
Focuses user attention on critical actions and messages, improving conversion and clarity.

### 4. Functionality Indicators

These show how users can interact with the interface, including buttons, input fields, checkboxes, sliders, etc.

**Example:**
A wireframe for a checkout page might include input fields for billing information and a button labeled “Confirm Purchase.”

**Contribution to Design:**
Helps developers and stakeholders visualize user interactions and plan logic and behaviors accordingly.

Wireframes should remain simple and focus on structure and flow—leaving detailed visual styling (like colors and fonts) to the next stage in the design process.
